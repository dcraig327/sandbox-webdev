use capitals as aliases for hard-coded const values ie:

const pageLoadTime
const COLOR_PINK

A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning describing the data it stores.

HOWTO: Name variables & functions

In a real project most o fthe time is spent modifying an dextending an existing code base. When we return to some code after doing something else for a while, it's much easier to find information that is well-labeled.

Good rules:
* use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart
* stay away from abbreviatsions or short names like a, x, i
* make names maximally descriptive and consise. Bad names: data, value. Which says nothing.
* agree on terms within your team and in your own mind. if a site visitor is called a "user" then we should name related variables currentUser or newUser instead of currentVisitor or newManInTown.



* numbers
  * int, float, Infinity, -Infinity, NaN, BitInt
  * [-2**53-1, 2**53 -1]
  * const bigInt = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
* strings
  * "", '', 
  * let name = "user"; alert('hi ${user}');
* boolean
  * true, false
* null
* undefined
* object
* symbol
* function


typeof(..)
