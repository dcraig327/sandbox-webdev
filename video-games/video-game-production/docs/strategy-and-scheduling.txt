when learning a new skill, strategy is like creating a curriculum or a plan.
scheduling is like creating accountability for achieving a plan.
throughout the day small tasks will pop up and need to be categorized into their proper bucket and assigned a priority.
an example task could even be decide where to document tasks or strategies on how to organize tasks.

in this repo I feel it best to document any tasks related to the education or progress of video game production.
I may have to use a seperate tool to do so, so unsure really how to link a trello board here, for example.

I feel if my goal is to only work on this project when using the computer,
that I should document everything related to my computer use here. But then there's matters of social media,
or more specifically the addiction to negativity that is inherent in my being. I feel that addiction is necessary as
it lets me understand 'how good I have it'. I feel more research needs to be invested back into self help topics
and matters of motivation and better understanding my mind to truely be more productive.

TODO: research self help, motivation, meditation. Schedule time listening to Alan Watts instead of silence.
TODO: create a digital schedule (calendar), planner (trello), task bucket,
