      How to make a video game
      For free. Right now!

      My name is Mr. Craig and I'm going to show you how. Making the game will be a game and the only thing you'll need to do is to set the difficulty level to that game to match your skill level.
      
      Have you ever played a game that let you choose the game's difficulty? I have and I would choose the Medium difficulty and if that was too frustrating I would lower it to Easy difficulty. Then after a while Easy wasn't challenging so I increased the difficulty to Medium and when that was no longer a challenge I went to the Hardest difficulty.

      The key lesson I've learned. If I was *frustrated* I would lower the difficulty and if I was *bored* I would increase the difficulty. Eventually I would reach my goal, to beat the game.

      I have to be honest first. You're not going to make Call of Duty or Minecraft as your first or even your second video game. When you're ready to make those large games, there will be people around you that will make it fun and be next to you. You'll be working on one thing and they'll be working on another thing.

      Those people who work on the large games, they have made dozens of smaller games and are now working at their dream job. How did they get their dream job? They showed them the dozens of games they made of course! Not only will you be working towards learning how to make good games, but you'll be building you list of games to help you get your dream job! If you -work- play hard, you can even get the job before you're old enough to enroll into college. Tell your parents to buy you a nice car instead of that college education. :)

      Easy: Scratch
      Medium: PyGame
