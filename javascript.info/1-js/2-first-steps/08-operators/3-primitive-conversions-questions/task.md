# Type conversions

Let's recap type conversions in the context of operators.

What will be the result for these expressions?

```js no-beautify
"" + 1 + 0
"" - 1 + 0
true + false
6 / "3"
2" * "3"
4 + 5 + "px"
$" + 4 + 5
"4" - 2
"4px" - 2
7 / 0
"  -9\n" + 5
"  -9\n" - 5
null + 1
undefined + 1
```

Think well, write down and then compare with the answer.
