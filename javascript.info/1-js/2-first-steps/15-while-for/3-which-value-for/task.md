# Which values get shown by the "for" loop?

For each loop scribe down which values it is going to show.

Then compare with the answer.

1. The postfix form:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
    ```
2. The prefix form:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );
    ```
