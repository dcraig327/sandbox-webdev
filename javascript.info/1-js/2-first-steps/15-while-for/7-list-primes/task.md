# Output prime numbers

[importance 3]

An integer number greater than `1` is called a [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) if it cannot be not divided without a remainder by anything except `1` and itself.

In other words, `n>1` is a prime if the result of it's division by anything except `1` and `n` is not integer.

For example, `5` is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by `2`, `3` and `4`.

**Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from `2` to `10`.**

The result will be `2,3,5,7`.

P.S. The code should be easily modifiable for other intervals.
