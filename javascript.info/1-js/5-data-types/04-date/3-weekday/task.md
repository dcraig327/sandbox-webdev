# European weekday

European countries have days of week starting with monday (number 1), then tuesday (number 2) and till sunday (number 7). Write a function `getLocalDay(date)` that returns the "european" day of week for `date`.

```js no-beautify
let date = new Date(2012, 0, 3);  // 3 Jan 2012
alert( getLocalDay(date) );       // tuesday, should show 2
```
