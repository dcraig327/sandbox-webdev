# Code editors

For the comfortable development we need a good code editor.

It must support at least:

<ol>
<li>Syntax highlight.</li>
<li>Autocompletion.</li>
<li>Folding -- hiding/opening blocks of code.</li>
</ol>

## IDE

The term "IDE" (Integrated Development Environment) -- denotes an editor which is extended by a number of plugins, can work with additional systems, such as bugtrackering, version control and much more.

Usually IDE loads the "project" and then can navigate between files, provide autocompletion based on the whole project, do other "project-level" stuff.

If you haven't considered selecting an IDE, pleae look at the following variants:

<ul>
<li>IntelliJ editors: [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for frontend development and [PHPStorm (PHP)](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), [IDEA (Java)](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [RubyMine (Ruby)](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) and other if you need additional languages.</li>
<li>Visual Studio is fine if you're a .NET developer.</li>
<li>Eclipse-based products, like [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/) and Zend Studio.</li>
<li>[Komodo IDE](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide) and it's lightweight free version [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit).</li>
<li>[Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/)</li>
</ul>

All of them with the exception of Visual Studio are cross-platform.

Most IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer's salary, so just choose what's most convenient.

## Lightweight editors

Lightweight editors are not as powerful as IDE, but they're fast and simple.

They are mainly used to instantly open and edit a file.

The main differenct between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that the latter works on a project-level, meaning it has to load a lot of data to start, and the former one opens just the files. That's much faster.

In practice, "lightweight" editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there's no strict frontier between a "lightweight editor" and an IDE. There's no point in argueing what is what.

The following options deserve your attention:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> (cross-platform, shareware).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">SciTe</a> (Windows, free).</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/">Notepad++</a> (Windows, free).</li>
<li>Vim, Emacs are cool. If you know how to use them.</li>
</ul>

## My editors

I believe one should have both an IDE for projects and a lightweight editor for quick-n-fast file editing.

I'm using:
<ul>
<li>Jetbrains editors as IDE: [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for JS and if I have other language in the project, then [PHPStorm (PHP)](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), [IDEA (Java)](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [RubyMine (Ruby)](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/). These guys provide editors for other languages too, but I didn't use them.</li>
<li>As a lightweight editor -- <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>.</li>
<li>Visual Studio, sometimes very rarely if that's a .NET project (Win).</li>
</ul>

If you don't know what to choose -- you can consider those.

## Let's not argue

The editors listed above are those that me or my friends -- good developers use for a long time and happy with them.

There are of course other great editors, please choose the one you like the most.

The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habbits, personal preferences.
