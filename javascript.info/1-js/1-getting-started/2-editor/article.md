# Code editors

The code editor is the place where a programmer spends most his time. 

There are two archetypes: IDE and lightweight editors. Many people feel comfortable choosing one tool of each type.

## IDE

The term [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment) is a powerful editor with many additional features that usually operates on a "whole project".

An IDE loads the project (can be many files), and then allows navigate between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project, does other "project-level" stuff.

If you haven't considered selecting an IDE, pleae look at the following variants:

- IntelliJ editors: [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for frontend development and [PHPStorm (PHP)](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), [IDEA (Java)](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [RubyMine (Ruby)](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) and other if you need additional languages.
- Visual Studio is fine if you're a .NET developer.
- Eclipse-based products, like [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/) and Zend Studio.
- [Komodo IDE](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide) and it's lightweight free version [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit).
- [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/)

All of them with the exception of Visual Studio are cross-platform.

Most IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer's salary, so just choose the best one for you.

## Lightweight editors

"Lightweight editors" are not as powerful as IDEs, but they're fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to instantly open and edit a file.

The main difference between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that the latter works on a project-level, meaning it has to load a lot of data to start, and the former one opens just the files. That's much faster.

In practice, "lightweight" editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there's no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE. 

The following options deserve your attention:

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Notepad++](http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/) (Windows, free).
- Vim, Emacs are cool. If you know how to use them.

## My favorites

I believe one should have both an IDE for projects and a lightweight editor for quick and easy file editing.

I'm using:

- [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for JS, and if there is one more language in the project, then I switch to other Jetbrains editors like [PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) (PHP), [IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Java), [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) (Ruby). There are editors for other languages too, but I didn't use them.
- As a lightweight editor -- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com).

If you don't know what to choose -- you can consider these ones.

## Let's not argue

The editors in the lists above are those that me or my friends -- good developers use for a long time and are happy with.

There are other great editors in our big world, please choose the one you like the most.

The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habbits, personal preferences.
