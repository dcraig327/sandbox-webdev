# Promises chaining

Let's formulate the problem mentioned in the chapter <info:callback-hell>:

- We have a sequence of asynchronous tasks to be done one after another. For instance, loading scripts.
- How to code it well?

Promises provide a couple of recipes to do that.

[cut]

In this chapter we cover promise chaining.

It looks like this:

```js run
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000); // (*)

}).then(function(result) { // (**)

  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 2
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 4
  return result * 2;

});
```

Here the first promise resolves in 1 second `(*)`, then the first handler is called `(**)`, its result is passed down to the second one etc. The result is passed along the chain of handlers, so we can see a sequence of `alert` calls: `1` -> `2` -> `4`.

![](promise-then-chain.png)

The whole thing works, because a call to `promise.then` returns a promise, so that we can call next `.then` on it, to get a new promise and so on.

A result of a handler becomes a result of the promise returned by the corresponding `.then`.

Please note: technically we can also add many `.then` to a single promise, without any chaining, like here:

```js run
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
});

promise.then(function(result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});

promise.then(function(result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});

promise.then(function(result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});
```

...But that's a totally different thing. All `.then` on the same promise get the same result -- the result of that promise:

![](promise-then-many.png)

So in the code above all `alert` show the same: 1. There is no result-passing between them.

In practice chaining is used far more often than adding many handlers to the same promise.

## Returning promises

Normally, a value returned by a `.then` handler is immediately passed to the next handler. But there's an exception.

If the returned value is a promise, then the further execution is suspended until it settles. And then the result of that promise is given to the next `.then` handler.

For instance:

```js run
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 1

*!*
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);
  });
*/!*

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 2

*!*
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);
  });
*/!*

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 4

});
```

Here each `.then` returns `new Promise(â€¦)`. When it settles, the result is passed on.

So the output is again 1 -> 2 > 4, but with 1 second delay between `alert` calls.

That feature allows to build chains of asynchronous actions.

## Example: loadScript

Let's use it with `loadScript` to load scripts one by one, sequentially:

```js run
loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/one.js")
  .then(function(script) {
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/two.js");
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js");
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    // use functions declared in scripts
    // to show that they indeed loaded
    one();
    two();
    three();
  });
```

Here each `loadScript` call returns a promise, and the next `.then` awaits until it resolves. So scripts are loaded one after another.

We can add more asynchronous actions to the chain, and the code is still "flat", no signs of "pyramid of doom".

## Error handling

Asynchronous actions may sometimes fail. For instance, `loadScript` fails if there's no such script. In that case the promise becomes rejected, so we can use `.catch` to handle it.

Luckily, chaining is great for catching errors. When a promise rejects, the control jumps to the closest rejection handler down the chain. That's very convenient.

In the example below we append `.catch` to handle all errors in the scripts loading chain:

```js run
*!*
loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/ERROR.js")
*/!*
  .then(function(script) {
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/two.js");
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js");
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    alert('done!');
  })
*!*
  .catch(function(error) { // (*)
    alert(error.message);
  });
*/!*
```

In the code above the first `loadScript` call fails, because `ERROR.js` doesn't exist. The control jumps to the closest error handler `(*)`.

In the example below the second script fails to load. Please note that the same `.catch` handles it, just because it's the closest one down the chain:


```js run
loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/one.js")
  .then(function(script) {
*!*
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/ERROR.js");
*/!*
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js");
  })
  .then(function(script) {
    alert('done!');
  })
*!*
  .catch(function(error) {
    alert(error.message);
  });
*/!*
```

The `.catch` works like in a `try..catch` block. We may have as many `.then` as we want, and then use a single `.catch` at the end to handle errors in all of them.


## Implicit try..catch

The code inside the executor and handlers has something like an invisible `try..catch` around it. If an error happens, it's considered a rejection.

For instance, this code:

```js run
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
*!*
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
*/!*
}).catch(function(error) {
  alert(error.message); // Whoops!
});
```

...Works the same way as this:

```js run
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
*!*
  reject(new Error("Whoops!"));
*/!*  
}).catch(function(error) {
  alert(error.message); // Whoops!
});
```

The `Promise` constructor automatically catches the error and treats it as a rejection.

That works not only in the executor, but in handlers as well. If we `throw` inside `.then` handler, that means a rejected promise, so the control jumps to the nearest error handler.

Here's an example:

```js run
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  resolve("ok");
}).then(function(result) {
*!*
  // .then returns a rejected promise
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
*/!*
}).catch(function(error) {
  // and the error is handled here
  alert(error.message); // Whoops!
});
```

That's so not only for `throw`,
 but for any errors, including programming errors as well:

```js run
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  resolve("ok");
}).then(function(result) {
*!*
  blabla(); // no such function
*/!*
}).catch(function(error) {
  alert(error.message); // blabla is not defined
});
```

To summarize, a promise handler can finish in three ways:

1. It can return a value (or undefined if there's no `return`). Then the promise returned by `.then` becomes fulfilled, and the next handler is called with that value.
2. It can throw an error. Then the promise returned by `.then` becomes rejected and the closest rejection handler is called.
3. It can return a promise. Then JavaScript awaits its result and goes on with it.

## Rethrowing

As we already noticed, `.catch` behaves like `try..catch`. We may have as many `.then` as we want, and then use a single `.catch` at the end to handle errors in all of them.

In a regular `try..catch` we can analyze the error and maybe rethrow it if can't handle. The same thing is possible for promises.

If we `throw` inside `.catch`, then the control goes to the next closest error handler. And if we finish normally, then it continues to the closest successful `.then` handler.

In the example below the error is fully handled, and the execution continues normally:

```js run
// the execution: catch -> then
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  throw new Error("Whoops!");

}).catch(function(error) {

  alert("Handled it!");
*!*
  return "result"; // return, the execution goes the "normal way"
*/!*

*!*
}).then(alert); // result shown
*/!*
```

...And here's an example of "rethrowing":


```js run
// the execution: catch -> catch -> then
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  throw new Error("Whoops!");

}).catch(function(error) { // (*)

  alert("Can't handle!");

*!*
  throw error; // throwing this or another error jumps to the next catch
*/!*

}).catch(error => {

  alert("Trying to handle again...");
  // don't return anything => execution goes the normal way

}).then(alert); // undefined
```

The handler `(*)` catches the error. In real project it would try to handle it somehow, but here it just throws it again. So the execution jumps to the next `.catch` down the chain.

## Unhandled rejections

...But what if we forget to append an error handler to the end of the chain?

Like here:

```js untrusted run refresh
new Promise(function() {
  errorHappened(); // Error here (no such function)
});
```

Or here:

```js untrusted run refresh
new Promise(function() {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).then(function() {
  // ...something...
}).then(function() {
  // ...something else...
}).then(function() {
  // ...but no catch after it!
});
```

Technically, when an error happens, the promise state becomes "rejected", and the execution should jump to the closest rejection handler. But there is no such handler in the examples above.

Usually that means that the code is bad. Most JavaScript engines track such situations and generate a global error. In the browser we can catch it using `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection')` (as specified in the [HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#unhandled-promise-rejections)):


```js run
window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', function(event) {
  // the event object has two special properties:
  alert(event.promise); // [object Promise] - the promise that generated the error
  alert(event.reason); // Error: Whoops! - the unhandled error object
});

new Promise(function() {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).then(function() {
  // ...something...
}).then(function() {
  // ...something else...
}).then(function() {
  // ...but no catch after it!
});
```

In non-browser environments there are also a similar events, so we can always track unhandled errors in promises.

## Summary

- A call to `.then/catch` returns a promise, so we can chain them.
- There are 3 possible outcomes of a handler:
    1. Return normally -- the result is passed to the closest successful handler down the chain.
    2. Throw an error -- it is passed to the closest rejection handler down the chain.
    3. Return a promise -- the chain waits till it settles, and then its result is used.

That allows to put a "queue" of actions into the chain.

Here's a more complex example. The function `showMessage` loads a message and shows it:

```js run
function showMessage() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    alert('loading...');
    return loadScript('/article/promise-chaining/getMessage.js');
  }).then(function(script) {
    let message = getMessage(); // getMessage function comes from the script
    return animateMessage(message);
  }).catch(function(err) { /*...*/ });
}

function animateMessage(message) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // should be asynchronous animation
    alert(message);
    resolve();  
  });
}

showMessage();
```
